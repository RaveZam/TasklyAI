TasklyAI

A lightweight kanban board tool built with Next.js and Supabase, designed for students and small teams who find tools like ClickUp too heavy.

TasklyAI keeps productivity simple — create tasks, drag them across a kanban board, and let AI help you break down goals into actionable subtasks.
